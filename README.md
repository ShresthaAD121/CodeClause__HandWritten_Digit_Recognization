# CodeClause__HandWritten_Digit_Recognization
Hand Written Digit Recognization , a deep learning model . To implement this I used a special type of deep neural network called Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). In the end, I have also designed a Graphical user interface(GUI) where I can directly draw the digits and recognize it straight away.
